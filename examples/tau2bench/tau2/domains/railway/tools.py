"""
Railway tools: Toolkit for the railway reservation system.

This toolkit mirrors the structure and common operations of the AirlineTools,
adapted to railway data models. It provides frequently used tools for:
- searching trains,
- booking reservations,
- updating reservations (bags, bikes, trains, passengers),
- cancelling reservations,
- querying users/reservations,
- getting train status,
- wallet top-ups,
- and a few generic helpers.

Assumptions:
- Train DB does not model seat availability; we simulate seat assignment and pricing.
- Pricing is derived from service_type and travel_class using fixed base fares.
- Membership discounts apply to fare components only (not to fees/insurance).
- Wallet balances are whole-dollar integers; wallet payments must be in whole dollars.
